# Endless Runner

## What is this?
Endless Runner takes some inspiration from a variety of well-loved games like Crash Bandicoot, Ratchet & Clank, Temple Run and Subway Surfers! It is inspired by Jimmy Vegas video series [How to make a 3D endless runner game in unity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5hRtTEhnOA&list=PLZ1b66Z1KFKit4cSry_LWBisrSbVkEF4t) on YouTube.

It's a FREE 3D Platformer/Endless Runner hybrid game for PC using the Unity Engine. 

Combining 3D Platformer elements with Endless stages in a Low(ish) Poly world, the game becomes fun and addictive! With a small Hypercasual system thrown in for good measure, you'll be on your way to completing the Game!

## What do you do in the game?
Simple! You select a stage, select a character and run as far as you can collecting as many coins and gems as possible.
